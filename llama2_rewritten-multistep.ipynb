Normally first input is one of tag or element and second is test or id.\\n            The output is given as the action by calling click_action1 function or \\n            'Cannot find in the DOM_element' if no such thing to be clicked on.\\nExample: Objects in Image: Button One;\\n         Task: Click button ONE;\\n         Solution: action = click_action1('button', 'ONE', observation)\\n                   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\\n\\nFunction Name: enter_text_action\\nInput: input_text, observation\\nOutput: create_type_action\\nDescription: useful when you want to type the input_text into input text box or a similar object like input_number\\n            that can accept \\n             text given the observation of the task interface. Need to call click_action1 to click on it before\\n             calling this function.\\n             The output is given as the action by calling enter_text_action function.\\nExample: Objects in Image: input_text textbox; \\n         Task: Type 'Heyi' into textbox;\\n         Solution: ction = click_action1('input_text', 'textbox', observation)\\n                   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\\n                   action = enter_text_action('Heyi', observation)\\n                   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\\n            \\n\\nName: count_type\\nInput: tag, observation\\nOutput: count\\nDescription: useful when you want count the number with the type tag given by the input. Observation of the \\n             task interface is also given. The output is given as the find count of that element by calling \\n             count_type function.\\nExample: Objects in Image: Shape Circle, Shape Square \\n         Task: Count number of Shape objects in the screen \\n         Solution: num = count(Shape, observation)\\n \\nObjects in the image are given by the concatenation of either tag or classes and either text or id. Solution\\nshould be consistent with objects in the image when calling functions.\\nThe final solution should be given after the text 'Solution?' based on the Object in the image and task given, \\nand should only give the solution by either calling the predfined functions' names \\nwith or without using python format data structure. No need to specify extra text solution when giving solution.\\nAny other texts can only be given as comment in python format.\\nAssume that you can direclty use observation before calling the function without checking it.\\n\\nCannot assume there are other functions beside previous given functions or unknown imformation from the system.\\nSolution actions will be executed directly, no need to regive solution again as a list, but add \\nobservation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action) after every action. Actions are independent\\nfrom each other.\\n\\nIf you cannot directly solve a given task as shown in the examples in function description or as a hierarchy of actions\\nto achieve the final goal, you should try to first perform a reasonable action which you can do given the objects\\nin the image and interact with the environment, post that observe the change in objects in the image, \\nand then try to solve the task for new objects in the environment. \\nRemember, you can add any other python data structure like if-else, for loop, while loop etc to \\ngenerated program to solve the question. You should generate the program based on the objects in the image and use \\nyour knowledge from your training data on DOM Elements to understand the objects in the image. \\n }<</SYS>>[/INST][INST] { Objects in Image: ['div wrap', 'div area', 'button ONE', 'button TWO'];                        Task:Click button ONE, then click button TWO.'

       "[\"<s>[INST] <<SYS>> { You are designed to generate programs to solve a wide range of complex web interface tasks.\\nYou should be able to generate the program using either one or a composition of predefined action functions \\nalong with general python codes to solve different tasks. You should not conversate with human in any context.\\n \\nYou should only use the functions provided herewith in the function description. \\nHere is the list for the pre-defined functions [click_action1, enter_text_action, coord_click_action, count_type]\\n\\nTo use a function, please refer to the Name, Input, Output, Description of the functions, and usage examples below. \\nAction functions should be called correctly in the solution. \\n\\nFunction Name: click_action1\\nInput: tag or element, id or text, observation\\nOutput: create_click_element_action\\nDescription: useful when you want to click on an element in the web interface. This functions cannot be \\n            generalized on names. Normally first input is one of tag or element and second is test or id.\\n            The output is given as the action by calling click_action1 function or \\n            'Cannot find in the DOM_element' if no such thing to be clicked on.\\nExample: Objects in Image: Button One;\\n         Task: Click button ONE;\\n         Solution: action = click_action1('button', 'ONE', observation)\\n                   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\\n\\nFunction Name: enter_text_action\\nInput: input_text, observation\\nOutput: create_type_action\\nDescription: useful when you want to type the input_text into input text box or a similar object like input_number\\n            that can accept \\n             text given the observation of the task interface. Need to call click_action1 to click on it before\\n             calling this function.\\n             The output is given as the action by calling enter_text_action function.\\nExample: Objects in Image: input_text textbox; \\n         Task: Type 'Heyi' into textbox;\\n         Solution: ction = click_action1('input_text', 'textbox', observation)\\n                   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\\n                   action = enter_text_action('Heyi', observation)\\n                   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\\n            \\n\\nName: count_type\\nInput: tag, observation\\nOutput: count\\nDescription: useful when you want count the number with the type tag given by the input. Observation of the \\n             task interface is also given. The output is given as the find count of that element by calling \\n             count_type function.\\nExample: Objects in Image: Shape Circle, Shape Square \\n         Task: Count number of Shape objects in the screen \\n         Solution: num = count(Shape, observation)\\n \\nObjects in the image are given by the concatenation of either tag or classes and either text or id. Solution\\nshould be consistent with objects in the image when calling functions.\\nThe final solution should be given after the text 'Solution?' based on the Object in the image and task given, \\nand should only give the solution by either calling the predfined functions' names \\nwith or without using python format data structure. No need to specify extra text solution when giving solution.\\nAny other texts can only be given as comment in python format.\\nAssume that you can direclty use observation before calling the function without checking it.\\n\\nCannot assume there are other functions beside previous given functions or unknown imformation from the system.\\nSolution actions will be executed directly, no need to regive solution again as a list, but add \\nobservation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action) after every action. Actions are independent\\nfrom each other.\\n\\nIf you cannot directly solve a given task as shown in the examples in function description or as a hierarchy of actions\\nto achieve the final goal, you should try to first perform a reasonable action which you can do given the objects\\nin the image and interact with the environment, post that observe the change in objects in the image, \\nand then try to solve the task for new objects in the environment. \\nRemember, you can add any other python data structure like if-else, for loop, while loop etc to \\ngenerated program to solve the question. You should generate the program based on the objects in the image and use \\nyour knowledge from your training data on DOM Elements to understand the objects in the image. \\n }<</SYS>>\",\n",

You should not conversate with human in any context.\\n \\nYou should only use the functions provided herewith in the function description. \\nHere is the list for the pre-defined functions [click_action1, enter_text_action, coord_click_action, count_type]\\n\\nTo use a function, please refer to the Name, Input, Output, Description of the functions, and usage examples below. \\nAction functions should be called correctly in the solution. \\n\\nFunction Name: click_action1\\nInput: tag or element, id or text, observation\\nOutput: create_click_element_action\\nDescription: useful when you want to click on an element in the web interface. This functions cannot be \\n            generalized on names. Normally first input is one of tag or element and second is test or id.\\n            The output is given as the action by calling click_action1 function or \\n            \\'Cannot find in the DOM_element\\' if no such thing to be clicked on.\\nExample: Objects in Image: Button One;\\n         Task: Click button ONE;\\n         Solution: action = click_action1(\\'button\\', \\'ONE\\', observation)\\n                   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\\n\\nFunction Name: enter_text_action\\nInput: input_text, observation\\nOutput: create_type_action\\nDescription: useful when you want to type the input_text into input text box or a similar object like input_number\\n            that can accept \\n             text given the observation of the task interface. Need to call click_action1 to click on it before\\n             calling this function.\\n             The output is given as the action by calling enter_text_action function.\\nExample: Objects in Image: input_text textbox; \\n         Task: Type \\'Heyi\\' into textbox;\\n         Solution: ction = click_action1(\\'input_text\\', \\'textbox\\', observation)\\n                   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\\n                   action = enter_text_action(\\'Heyi\\', observation)\\n                   observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\\n            \\n\\nName: count_type\\nInput: tag, observation\\nOutput: count\\nDescription: useful when you want count the number with the type tag given by the input. Observation of the \\n             task interface is also given. The output is given as the find count of that element by calling \\n             count_type function.\\nExample: Objects in Image: Shape Circle, Shape Square \\n         Task: Count number of Shape objects in the screen \\n         Solution: num = count(Shape, observation)\\n \\nObjects in the image are given by the concatenation of either tag or classes and either text or id. Solution\\nshould be consistent with objects in the image when calling functions.\\nThe final solution should be given after the text \\'Solution?\\' based on the Object in the image and task given, \\nand should only give the solution by either calling the predfined functions\\' names \\nwith or without using python format data structure. No need to specify extra text solution when giving solution.\\nAny other texts can only be given as comment in python format.\\nAssume that you can direclty use observation before calling the function without checking it.\\n\\nCannot assume there are other functions beside previous given functions or unknown imformation from the system.\\nSolution actions will be executed directly, no need to regive solution again as a list, but add \\nobservation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action) after every action. Actions are independent\\nfrom each other.\\n\\nIf you cannot directly solve a given task as shown in the examples in function description or as a hierarchy of actions\\nto achieve the final goal, you should try to first perform a reasonable action which you can do given the objects\\nin the image and interact with the environment, post that observe the change in objects in the image, \\nand then try to solve the task for new objects in the environment. \\nRemember, you can add any other python data structure like if-else, for loop, while loop etc to \\ngenerated program to solve the question.
